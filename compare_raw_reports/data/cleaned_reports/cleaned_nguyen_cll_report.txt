Diagnosis Peripheral blood Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Bone marrow Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, see comment. Decreased iron stores. NDN 01 04 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 7 shows an abnormal B cell population about 92 of the cells in lymphocytic gate or 68 of bone marrow cells that is positive for CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. Surface kappa and lambda light chain is negative. However, the B cells do show cytoplasmic kappa light chain restriction. These B cells are negative for CD10, FMC7, and CD38. These B cells have small nuclear size based on forward scatter signal . These results, together morphological findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow, are consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . Bone marrow aspirate was sent for chromosome analysis, CLL FISH panel, and IgVH mutation Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type chronic lymphocytic leukemia Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 7 Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 68 year old male with history of CLL diagnosed in 2009 ; restaging bone marrow. Gross Description The specimen is received in 2 parts, each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow clot on the requisition is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin and in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a 3.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter red brown cylindrical core of bone which is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
