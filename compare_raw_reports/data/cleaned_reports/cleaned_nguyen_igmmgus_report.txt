Diagnosis Peripheral blood Hypchromic normocytic anemia Mild leukopenia Bone marrow Presence of 40 monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow, consistent with plasma cell myeloma, see comment Congo Red stain is negative for amyloid deposit in bone marrow Adequate iron stores NDN FGA 06 22 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 326 in gate 1 shows a T cell population about 72 of the lymphocytes analyzed with no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a small B cell population 2 of the lymphocytes analyzed . Analysis of cells gated for CD38 positivity shows a large monoclonal plasma cell population that is positive for cytoplasmic lambda light chain restriction. These plasma cells are negative for CD19 and CD56. These results, together with the finding of 40 plasma cells in bone marrow, are consistent with plasma cell myeloma. Immunohistochemical stains, with adequate controls, are performed on clot and biopsy for CD138. The stains show 40 plasma cells in bone marrow pos for CD138 . Congo Red stain is performed on clot and biopsy. The stain under polarized light show no evidence of amyloid deposit Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, and myeloma FISH panel. Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type plasma cell myeloma Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 326 Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow was obtained by IR Clinical Information 59 year old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma diagnosed 2005 . He was admitted during that time for acute kidney injury. Renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial nephritis and immune complex glomerulonephritis. Subsequent bone marrow showed 10 plasma cell and concurrent SPEP and IFE showed monoclonal gammopathy IgG lambda isotype. The patient is noncompliant and refused treatment during that time. He returned on May 2016 presenting with a submandibular mass, which was excised and is positive for amyloidosis. The patient is undergoing bone marrow biopsy to assess underlying disease and for treatment plan. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled clot are multiple red brown portions of clotted blood measuring 2.8 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown, gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassettes 1A 2. Received in formalin labeled core are three red brown, cylindrical cores of bone, two measuring 0.8 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter and one measuring 0.3 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
