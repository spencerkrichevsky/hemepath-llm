Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Hypochromic normocytic anemia Bone marrow Hypocellular for age 40 No evidence of residual leukemic promyelocytes or leukemic myeloblasts, see comment Decreased iron stores NDN DMS 05 02 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 224 shows a lymphocytic population Gate 1 with normal immunophenotype. A small population of hematogones is found Gate 2 which express CD45 down regulated , CD34, CD10 bright signal intensity , CD19, CD38 bright signal intensity , and TdT. Scattergrams show a smear out pattern indicating a continuum of maturation, consistent with that of hematogones. The hematogones account for approximatedly 6 of the bone marrow cells. Hematogones may be increased in regenerating bone marrow as seen in this patient after chemotherapy. Myeloblasts account for about 1 of bone marrow cells with normal marker profile. These results indicate the presence of 6 hematogones; no evidence of residual leukemia by flow cytometry. Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FLT3 mutation, and PML RARA by quantitativePCR Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 36 y o male with a hx of APL diagnosed in 1 2018 , postive FLT3 mutation, s p chemotherapy. The most recent bone marrow 4 2018 was negative for cytogenetics, AML FISH panel and PCR for PML RARA. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. Part 1 received in formalin and labeled clot is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. Part 2 received in formalin and labeled core is a red brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 2.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The bone is submitted in its entirety in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
