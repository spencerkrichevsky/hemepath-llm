Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Normochromic hypochromic anemia and neutropenia Bone Marrow Normocellular for age 30 Increased erythropoiesis with mild dyserythropoiesis Arrest of granulocyte maturation Adequate iron stores NDN VJ 04 13 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Arrest of granulocyte maturation is seen in bone marrow which is likely the cause of neutropenia in this patient. Etiologies may include medication effect, among others. Clinical correlation is suggested Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogentetics and MDS FISH Panel; also microbiolgy cultures stains Tumor Summary Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 80 y o male presenting with neutropenia. Bone marrow in 2015 showed a normocellular marrow for age. MDS FISH negative and cytogenetics showed loss of Y chromosome. Now clinical concern about bone marrow suppression vs viral infection. Leukopenia, unclear origin, PMN of NIC on dialysis. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled clot is a red brown portion of clotted blood measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin and labeled core are two red brown delicate cylindrical cores of soft tissue measuring 0.1 and 1.0 cm in length and 0.1 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
