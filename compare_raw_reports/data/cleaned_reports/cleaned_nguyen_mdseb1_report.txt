Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Pancytopenia Bone Marrow Myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts 1 MDS EB 1 Adequate iron stores NDN DMM 03 16 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 131 in gate 2 shows a normal lymphocytic population B cell and T cells . Analysis of cells in gate 1 blast area shows a myeloblast population that is positive for CD34, CD13, CD33, CD117, CD38, and HLA DR. These blasts are negative for CD56, CD19, CD10, and TdT. They aberrantly expressed CD4. The blasts account for about 7 of the bone marrow nucleated cells in line with manual differential . These flow cytometry results, together with morphological findings, are consistent with MDS with excess blasts type 1 MDS EB 1 . Note that patient received chemotherapy for NHL previously. A therapy related MDS cannot be ruled out. Clinical correlation is suggested. No evidence of residual lymphoma is seen. Bone marrow biopsy is pending decal process. Findings on biopsy will be reported in Addendum Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FISH panel for MDS. Dr Idowu was notified of the findings on 3 16 18 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type MDS EB 1 Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 xx Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1.
