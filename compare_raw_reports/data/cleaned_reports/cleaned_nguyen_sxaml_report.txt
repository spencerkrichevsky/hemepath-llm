Diagnosis Peripheral blood Normocytic hypochromic anemia Leukocytosis with numerous blasts 80 Thrombocytopenia Bone marrow Acute myeloid leukemia, see comment Increased iron stores NDN 01 10 2017 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 17 20 in gate 1 blast area contains a predominant blast population more than 60 of the bone marrow cells . These cells are positive for CD2, CD7, CD13, CD15 partial , CD33, CD34, CD38, CD117, TdT partial , and HLA DR. They are negative for other T cell markers other than CD2 and CD7 , CD19, CD20, CD10, CD64, and MPO. These results are consistent with the patient s previous diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. The baseline bone marrow shows similar marker profile report AF 15 1171, dated 12 28 2015 Findings were notified to Neuro Trauma team on 1 6 17 18 30 Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, AML FISH panel, PCR testing for PLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and KIT mutations.
