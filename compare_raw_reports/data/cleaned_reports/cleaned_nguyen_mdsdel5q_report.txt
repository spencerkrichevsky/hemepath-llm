Diagnosis Peripheral blood Macrocytic hypochromic anemia Thrombocytopenia Bone marrow Normocellular for age Increased erythropoiesis with mild dyserythropoiesis, see comment Increased megakaryopoiesis with mild dysplasia Increased iron stores with no increase in ring sideroblasts NDN 01 12 2017 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Mild dysplastic changes are seen in erythroids and megakaryocytes. Myelodysplastic syndrome MDS cannot be ruled out Bone marrow aspirate was sent for MDS FISH panel and cytogenetics to rule out MDS. Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow clot 2. Bone marrow core, decal, touch prep Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow was obtained by IR Clinical Information Pancytopenia 83 year old male with a medical history of chronic afib, CAD, ICM who present with GI bleeding and pancytopenia. Gross Description 1. Received in formalin labeled with patient s name, medical record number, and BM clot is an irregular portion of maroon clotted blood 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm which is sectioned and entirely submitted in 1A. 2. Received in formalin labeled with patient s name, medical record number, and BM biopsy are two cylindrical portions of red bone 1.8 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter, in aggregate which are entirely submitted in 2A, following decalcification.
