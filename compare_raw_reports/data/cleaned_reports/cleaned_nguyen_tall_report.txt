Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Microcytic hypochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia Circulating lymphoblasts 3 Bone Marrow T lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma T cell ALL LBL , see comment Adequate iron stores NDN NDN 09 20 2022 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 22 744 shows 9 normal lymphocytes with mature B cells and T cells. Analysis of cells in CD45 dim gate shows a predominant T cell precursor population about 71 of all the cells analyzed . These T cells have small nuclear size based on forward scatter signal and show expression of CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, co expression of CD4 CD8, CD38. They are negative for CD34, CD117, HLA DR, CD13, CD33, CD16, CD10, CD19, CD64, CD14, CD56. The immunophenotype results and morphology are most consistent with T lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma T cell ALL LBL Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FISH panel for ALL pediatric The diagnosis was notified to Dr. xxx on 9 20 2022 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type T lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 22 xxx Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information The patient is a 10 y o male presenting with cough, fever, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss. He was found to have thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated uric acid LDH. CT scans show anterior mediastinal mass, bulky right paratracheal lymphadenopathy, bilateral supraclavicular, axillary, and hilar lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with mesenteric, retroperitoneum, and bilateral iliac chain lymphadenopathy. Gross Description The case is received in 2 parts labeled xxx 1. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient s name, MRN, bone marrow clot and consists of a single irregular bone marrow clot measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.2 cm which is submitted in toto in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient s name, MRN, bone marrow core and consists of a single tan red hemorrhagic cylindrical bone marrow core measuring 1.5 cm in length by 0.2 cm in diameter which is submitted in toto in cassette 2A, post light decalcification. hr 09 19 2022 14 45 Peripheral Smear Date time 09 19 2022,17 05 CBC Results WBC 9.1 K CMM Normal RBC 3.71 M CMM LOW Hgb 8.5 g dL LOW Hct 25.9 LOW MCV 69.9 fL LOW MCH 23.1 pg LOW MCHC 33.0 g dL Normal RDW 15.7 HI MPV 8.5 fL Normal Platelet 41 K CMM LOW Segs 37.0 Normal Bands 2.0 Normal Lymphocytes 50.0 HI Atypical Lymphs 0.0 Normal Monocytes 5.0 Normal Metamyelocytes 5.0 HI Myelocytes 1.0 HI Neutrophils 3.5 K CMM Normal Lymphocytes 4.6 K CMM Normal Monocytes 0.5 K CMM Normal NRBC 12 100WB NA PERIPHERAL BLOOD Erythrocytes Decreased in number; microcytic, hypochromic; mild polychromasia; schistocytes not increased; nucleated RBCs present; intracellular organisms absent White cells Normal in number; presence of a few blasts 3 Platelets Decreased in number; unremarkable morphology; platelet clumps absent Microscopic Description Bone marrow Differential on aspirate Lymphoblasts 77 Promyelocytes 1 Myelocytes 1 Metas 1 Bands PMN s 5 Eos 0 Baso 0 Monos 0 Lymphs 10 Plasma cells 0 Erythroids 5 Cellularity 95 Megakaryopoiesis Decreased Erythropoiesis Markedly decreased Iron Content aspirate Adequate iron stores Granulopoiesis Markedly decreased Lymphocytes Decreased Others Numerous lymphoblasts are present 77 Biopsy and clot section Diffuse distribution of lymphoblasts Iron content biopsy and clot section Adequate iron stores Non Clinical Documentation CPT 88305 x 2, 88313 x 2, 88311, 85097, 85060
