Comment

A moderate number of histiocytes in bone marrow are found with hemophagocytosis. The following findings in this patient support the diagnosis of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): pancytopenia, fever, markedly elevatd ferritin (19,273), elevated triglyceride (256), hemophagocytosis in bone marrow.

Specimen Source

1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot

2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep

3. Peripheral blood smear

Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR

 

Clinical Information

 

43 year old male with a PMH significant for pancytopenia and CNS vasculitis with concern for HLH.

 

Gross Description

The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 

1. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and bone marrow clot on the requisition is two red-brown gelatinous portions of clotted blood ranging from 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.1 cm to 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm.  The larger clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal red-brown gelatinous cut surfaces.  The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A.

 

2. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and bone marrow core on the requisition is a tan-red cylindrical core of bone measuring 2.6 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter.  The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.  PY/myf  05/01/2018 04:17
