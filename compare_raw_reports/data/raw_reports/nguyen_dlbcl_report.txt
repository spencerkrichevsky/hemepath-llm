Comment

-Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry (report HF-17-128) is not diagnostic, most likely due to inadequate number of lymphoma cells in aspirate.

 

-Immunohistochemical stains, with adequate controls, are performed on biopsy for CD20, CD10, bcl6 and bcl2. The lymphoma cells are positive for CD20, CD10, bcl6 and bcl2. The stains show lymphoma cells with paratrabecular pattern, some with interstitial pattern

 

-Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics and NHL-FISH panel

Clinical Information

Clinical History:  Follicular lymphoma/DLBCL

 

60 year old male diagnosed with follicular lymphoma/DLBCL of mediastinal mass and  and pleural diagnosed on 3/1/17.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

 

1.  Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and "bone marrow clot" on the requisition is a red-brown portion of clotted blood measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red-brown gelatinous cut surface. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassettes 1A and 1B.

 

2.  Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and "bone marrow biopsy" on the requisition is a red-brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 2.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.  PY/ec 03/16/2017 08:00
