Comment

-Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry (report HF-17-64) shows a monoclonal B cell population that is positive for CD19, CD20, CD23, CD22 and FMC-7 with kappa light chain restriction. This B-cell population is negative for CD5 and CD10. The outlined immunophenotypic findings are consistent with a B-cell lymphoma in this patient with a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma.

-Lymphoma infiltrates are seen surrounding trabecular bone (paratrabecular pattern). The lymphoma cells have small nuclei with clumped chromatin, consistent with lymphoma metastasis in this patient with recent diagnosis of low-grade follicular lymphoma.

-Due to discrepancy between CD10 results (negative in flow cytometry study for this bone marrow and positive in lymph node sample by immunohistochemical stain), immunohistochemical stains were ordered on this bone marrow biopsy for CD20, CD3, CD10, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6. Results will be reported in Addendum

- Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics

Comment

Due to discrepancy between CD10 results (negative in flow cytometry study for this bone marrow and positive in lymph node sample by immunohistochemical stain), immunohistochemical stains with adequate controls were performed on this bone marrow biopsy for CD20, CD3, CD10, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6. The malignant lymphocytes are positive for CD20, CD10, bcl2 and bcl6. They are negative for CD3. The immunohistochemical stains demonstrate significant interstitial lymphoma involvement in addition to paratrabacular pattern. The negative CD10 result by flow cytometry most likely represents different sensitivity of flow cytometry marker.
