Comment

-Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood by flow cytometry (report HF-17-349) shows predominant a B cell population (about 96% of all the cells analyzed). These B cells have small-intermediate nuclear size (based on forward-scatter signal) and show expression of CD10, CD19, CD38, HLA-DR, CD34, CD13, and TdT. They are negative for CD20, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD7, CD56, CD117, MPO, CD64, and CD33. Review of peripheral blood smear shows a predominant blast population.

-The immunophenotype results and morphology are consistent with precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia. Dr. A. Rios was notified of the findings on 7/25/17.

 

-Bone marrow aspirate was sent for chromosome analysis, FISH panel for ALL, and PCR for bcr/abl1.

Clinical Information

55 year old male admitted for loss of consciousness with acute subdural hematoma.  His PB smear showed 53% blasts, flow cytometry immunophenotyping is consistent with B lymphoblastic leukemia

 

Gross Description

The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient's name and MRN.

 

1. The specimen is red-purple, irregularly-shaped soft piece of tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm.  The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette 1A.

 

2. The specimen is labeled "BM BX" and is pink-tan, elongated, hard piece of tissue measuring 2.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm.  The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette 2A.  The specimen is submitted in light decalcification.   AM/myf  07/27/2017 21:40
