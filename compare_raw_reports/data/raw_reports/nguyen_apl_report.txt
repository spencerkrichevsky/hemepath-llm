Comment

-Immunophenotyping of concurrent peripheral blood sample by flow cytometry (report HF-21-577) shows a T cell population (about 75% of the lymphocytes analyzed) with no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a B cell population (about 5% of the lymphocytes analyzed) that is negative for CD5, CD10, no surface light-chain restriction. The lymphocytes have small nuclear size (based on forward-scatter signal). Analysis of the cells in the blast area shows 70% leukemic cells (of the leukocytes) with expression of CD13 (heterogeneous), CD33 (homogeneous), cMPO, and CD117. They are negative for: CD34, CD3, CD7, CD10, CD14, CD16, CD20, CD22, CD38, CD56, CD79a, CD123, HLA-DR, TdT. These results are consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Many leukemic cells are seen in the area with intermediate side-scatter signal.

 

-STAT FISH testing for PML/RARA is positive, consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia

- Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, Rapid AML therapeutic panel, and PCR for bcr/ab

-Oncology team (Dr Rios) was notified of the diagnosis on 9/10/2021

Clinical Information

39 y/o male with new-onset acute leukemia

 

Gross Description

The specimen is received in 2 containers: Edwards, James and 46429228

 

1.  The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, MRN, and " bone marrow clot."  It consists of a 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm aggregate of red-purple clotted blood which is submitted in toto in cassette 1A.

 

2.  The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, MRN, and " bone marrow core biopsy."  It consists of a 1.1 x 0.2 cm firm, tan-pink, cylindrical core of bone which is entirely submitted in cassette 2A following light decalcification.
