Comment

- Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry (report HF-20-428) for plasma cells gated using CD38 are positive for CD19, CD45, CD138; negative for CD117, CD56, CD20 and show no evidence of cytoplasmic light chain restriction. These results indicate no evidence of monoclonal plasma cells by flow cytometry.

- Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, and FISH panel for myeloma

Specimen Source

1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot

2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep

3. Peripheral blood smear

Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR

Clinical Information

Per medical record, the patient is a 47-year-old female with history of plasma cell myeloma status post treatment. Initial bone marrow (HB-17-48 & HF-17-95, 02/22/17) showed CD38 positive plasma cells with cytoplasmic kappa light chain restriction, CD 56 positive, CD19 negative and FISH positive for +5 and 11q+. Her last bone marrow (HB-20-82 & HF-20-138, 03/26/20) showed 0.4% polyclonal plasma cells with normal FISH and chromosomal analysis.

Gross Description

Two specimens are received, both labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 

 

1. Received in formalin and labeled "clot" is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm irregular portion of red-brown clotted blood. The specimen is trisected and submitted in its entirety in 1A.

2. Received in formalin and labeled "core" is a 0.5 cm in length by 0.2 cm in diameter tan-red bony core fragment. The specimen is submitted in toto in 2A, following light decalcification. RC 08/10/2020 12:44_
