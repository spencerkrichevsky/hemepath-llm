Comment

-Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood leukocytes by flow cytometry (report HF-17-205) shows a normal lymphoctic population in gate #2 (normal T cell and B cells, about 13% of sample cells). Analysis of cells in gate #1 shows a predominant monoblast population (about 11% of sample cells) that is positive for CD13, CD33, CD4, CD117, HLA-DR, CD38, CD14, CD15, CD64, and partial positivity for CD34. These blasts are negative for CD16, CD56, CD19, CD10, MPO, and TdT. A subpopulation of mature monocytes are found in gate #3 (about 28% of sample cells). They express CD13, CD33, CD4, HLA-DR, CD38, CD14, CD56, CD64. These blasts are negative for CD34, CD117, CD19, CD10, MPO, and TdT. These findings, together with morphology in peripheral blood (22% blasts) and bone marrow (46% blasts), are most consistent with acute myeloid leukemia. Positive HLA-DR and CD34 in blasts, together with morpholgy, do not support acute promyelocytic leukemia.

- Bone marrow aspirate was sent for ALM-FISH panel, cytogenetics, PCR testing for CEBPA, NPM1, C KIT, and FLT3

 

-Bone marrow clot and biopsy are pending (for processing). Results of clot and biopsy will be reported in Addendum

 

-Clinical Hematology team and Oncology team (Dr Rios) were notified of the diagnosis on 5/3/2017
