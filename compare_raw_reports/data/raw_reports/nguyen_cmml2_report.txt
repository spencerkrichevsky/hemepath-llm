Comment

-Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry (report HF- 18-231) shows a monoblast population that is positive for CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD4, CD56, HLA-DR, CD38, CD14, CD64, and CD15. They are negative for CD34, CD19, CD10, MPO, and TdT. The monoblasts account for about 11% of bone marrow cells.  These immunophenotyping results by flow cytometry, together with morphological findings, are most consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-2 (CMML-2).

 

-Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FISH panel for MPN, and NGS- MPN targeted molecular profile

 

- Findings were discussed with Dr A Rios and Dr Z Kanaan on 5/8/2018

Clinical Information

74 year old male with chronic monocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

 

Gross Description

The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

 

Part 1 received in formalin and labeled "clot" is a red-brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 7.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.  The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red-brown gelatinous cut surface.  The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A.

 

Part 2 received in formalin and labeled "core" is a red-brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.4 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter.  The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after brief decalcification.   PY/ddw  05/04/2018 19:02
