Comment

-Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry (report HF-18-52) shows predominant a B cell population (about 90% of all the cells analyzed). These B cells have small to imtermediate nuclear size (based on forward-scatter signal) and show expression of CD19, CD38, HLA-DR, and TdT. They are negative for CD20, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD56, CD34, CD13, CD117, and CD33. Review of peripheral blood smear shows a predominant lymphoblast population. These results, together with morphologic findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, are consistent with precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia.

-Dr. Rios was notified of the findings on 1/29/2018.

-Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, ALL FISH panel, PCR testing for bcr/abl1, and AFB/fungal stains/cultures.

 

-Biopsy and clot section are pending processing. Findings will be reported in Addendum
