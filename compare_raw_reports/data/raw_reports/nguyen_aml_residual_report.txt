Diagnosis

Peripheral Blood:

- Normochromic hypochromic anemia

- Leukopenia with circulating blasts

Bone Marrow:

- Residual acute myeloid leukemia (40% myeloblasts)

- Adequate iron stores

Comment

-Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry (HF-19-180) shows a myeloblast population (37% of total events) that is positive for CD4 (partial), CD7, CD10 (partial), CD13, CD19 (partial; 30%),  CD34, CD38, CD56, CD 117, HLA-DR. These blasts are negative for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD11b, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD20, CD33, CD64, and MPO. These findings are consistent with significant residual acute myeloid leukemia.

 

-Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, AML Molecular Profile, FISH testing for MECOM 3q26.2, t(8;21), and FLT3 mutations by PCR

Clinical Information

72 year old male with AML, s/p chemo (diagnosed 3/22/2019). Baseline marrow showed complex chromosomal abnormalities, FISH showing MECOM rearrangement, 21q+; AML molecular profile showing abnormal ASXL1, CSF3R, TET2

 

Gross Description

The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 

 

1. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, MRN number, and "clot," is a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm blood clot. The specimen is bisected and entirely embedded in cassette 1A.

 

2. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, MRN number, and "core," is a 1.1 x 0.2 bone core. The specimen is entirely embedded in cassette 2A for light decal.
