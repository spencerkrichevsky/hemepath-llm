Diagnosis

Peripheral Blood:

 - Pancytopenia

 

Bone Marrow:               

 - Hypocellular for age (30%)

 - No histological evidence of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

 - No evidence of malignancy

 - Decreased iron stores

Comment

No histologic evidence of HLH or malignancy is seen in bone marrow. Patient's pancytopenia is most likely secondary to hypocellular bone marrow. The etiologies for hypocellular bone marrow may include: viral infection, medication effect, and immune disorders. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in one part, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 

 

Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "bone marrow core" on the requisition are two tan-brown cylindrical cores of bone each measuring 0.7 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 1A after a brief decalcification.  PY/dg  01/29/2018 19:17
