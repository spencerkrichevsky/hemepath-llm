The MPO and Ecdherin stains show increase in granulocytes and decrease in erythoids. CD34 shows less than 2 positive cells. CD117 shows normal distribution of early granulocytes. FVIII stain shows normal distribution of megakaryocytes. Diffuse myelofibrosis is seen in biopsy which is the cause of pancytopenia and paucity of aspirate cells. Primary myelofibosis or myelofibrosis due to other pre existing myeloproliferatibe neoplasms P. vera, CML, and essential thrombocythemia are unlikely due to lack of prefibrotic presentations. The current peripheral blood smear also shows no evidence of tear drop cells, NRBCs or leukocyte left shift, typical findings in myelofibrosis associated with MPNs. Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis is ruled out without increase in myeloblasts. Other etiologies are also unlikely lymphoma especially Hodgkin lymphoma , reneal osteodystrophy, metastatic carcinoma.

Myelodysplastic syndrome with multilineage dysplasia; see comment. 2. Hypercellular marrow for age 80 cellularity with trilineage dysplasia and 7 myeloblasts; see comment. 3. Peripheral blood with macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Comment The bone marrow biopsy is hypercellular for age with prominent dysplastic changes affecting the erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic lineages consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome MDS . Flow cytometry revealed increased myeloblasts 7 characteristic of MDS with excess blasts 1 MDS EB 1 . Cytogenetic studies are pending, which will provide further classification and prognostic information. Clinical correlation and regular hematologic monitoring are recommended. ANCILLARY STUDY PLAN Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping Completed. See attached report for detailed findings. Cytogenetics Awaiting results. FISH for Chromosome 5q deletion Pending. PERIPHERAL BLOOD The complete blood count shows macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia consistent with dysplastic changes. White cell differential demonstrates normal distribution with no circulating blasts identified. No significant rouleaux formation or peripheral plasma cells are observed. ASPIRATE SMEAR The aspirate material is sufficient for evaluation, showing hypercellularity with erythroid predominance and dysplastic changes. Prominent features include nuclear cytoplasmic dyssynchrony and megaloblastic changes in erythroid precursors.
