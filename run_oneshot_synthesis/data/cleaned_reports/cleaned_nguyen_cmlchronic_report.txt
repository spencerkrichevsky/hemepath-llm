Bone marrow clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 46 year old male with no significant PMHx who was admitted for concern for leukemia. Patient initiall presentation was fever, chills, malaise and productive cough. He was found to have leukocytosis from an outside facility. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled clot is a red brown portion of clotted blood measuring 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm. The clot is submitted in toto in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin and labeled core is a tan red cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.9 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
