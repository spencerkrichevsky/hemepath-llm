Clinical correlation is suggested Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 62 year old male with history of ITP diagnosed in 2014 s p splenectomy and Rituximab, with stabilized platelets counts, now patient presents with Plt count of 8 up to 74 on day of bone marrow biopsy Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. Part 1 received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow clot on the requisition is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 3.1 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassettes 1A 1F. Part 2 received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow core biopsy on the requisition are two red brown cylindrical cores of bone measuring 0.7 and 0.3 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
