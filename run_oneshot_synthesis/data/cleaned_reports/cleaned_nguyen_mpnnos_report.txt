Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Marked leukocytosis with left shift Normocytic hypochromic anemia. Bone Marrow Markedly hypercellular for age 90 with increased granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, supportive of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, NOS Decreased iron stores NDN DMM 03 29 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 157 in Gate 1 shows a T cell population about 90 of the cells analyzed with no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a B cell population about 7 of the cells analyzed that is negative for CD5, CD10, no surface light chain restriction. Analysis of the cells in the blast area Gate 4 shows fewer than 3 normal myeloblasts of the bone marrow cells that are positive for CD13 and CD33. These results indicate no abnormal immunophenotypes are found with flow cytometry. The morphologic findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow are most supportive of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, NOS Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FISH panel for MPN. Dr Rios was noified of the findings on 3 29 18 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type MPN, NOS Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 157 Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 76 year old male with a possible myeloproliferative neoplasm. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled clot is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 0.8 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin and labeled core is a red brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
