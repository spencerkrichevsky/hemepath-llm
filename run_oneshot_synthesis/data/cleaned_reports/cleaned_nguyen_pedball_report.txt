Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Pancytopenia Bone Marrow B cell lymphoblastic leukemia, see comment Decreased iron stores 02 13 2018 11 20 ddw NDN 02 13 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 76 shows a predominant B lymphoblast population. These B cells have intermediate nuclear size based on forward scatter signal and show expression of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, CD34, CD22, HLA DR, and TdT. They are negative for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD7, CD56, CD13, CD117, MPO, and CD33. These results and morphology are consistent with B cell lymphoblastic leukemia B ALL . Bone marrow aspirate was sent for AFB fungal stains and cultures, and cytogenetics. Dr N. Rodridguez was notified of the findings on 2 13 2018 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type B cell lymphoblastic leukemia Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 76 Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information Clinical History 6 y o female with pancytopenia, acute onset fever, abdominal pain, MS change Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin in and labeled bone marrow clot is a red brown portion of clotted blood measuring 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin and labeled bone marrow is a red brown, cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
