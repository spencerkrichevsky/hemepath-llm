Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Erythrocytosis Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis Bone Marrow Hypercellular for age 60 with panmyelosis, supportive of Polycythemia Vera Negative for reticulin fibrosis Decreased iron stores NDN RKC 12 10 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 635 in Gate 1 shows a T cell population about 70 of the cells analyzed with no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a B cell population about 12 of the cells analyzed that is negative for CD5, CD10, no surface light chain restriction. The lymphocytes have small nuclear size based on forward scatter signal . Analysis of the cells in the blast area Gate 4 shows fewer than 2 blasts of the bone marrow cells that are positive for CD13 and CD33. These results show no abnormal immunophenotypes with flow cytometry. Reticulin stain, with adequate control, is performed on biopsy. The stain shows no obvious reticulin fibrosis only focal areas with thin fibers seen Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, molecular analysis for JAK2, FISH panels for MPN and Eosinophilia. Dr Apostolidu was notified of the findings on 12 10 18 Tumor Summary Specimen _ Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure bone marrow Aspiration site R post iliac crest Biopsy site R post iliac crest Histologic type Polycythemia Vera Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry performed Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 70 year old male with suspected polycythemia vera. Gross Description The case is received in 2 parts both labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled clot is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm portion of tan red clotted blood. The specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in 1A. 2. Received in formalin and labeled core is a 2.0 x 0.2 cm tan pink bony core fragment. The specimen is submitted in toto in 2A, following decalcification.
