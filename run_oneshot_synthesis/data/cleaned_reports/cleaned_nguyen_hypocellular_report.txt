Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Hypochromic normocytic anemia Leukopenia with neutropenia Bone Marrow Hypocellular for age 40 , see comment No morphologic evidence of malignancy Decreased iron stores NDN MDA 05 11 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment No evidence of malignancy is seen in bone marrow. The findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow are most supportive of cytopenia due to hypocellular bone marrow. Etiologies may include medication, viral infection, and immune disorders. Clincal correlation is suggested. Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FISH panel for MDS Tumor Summary Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 21 year old male with PMHx significant for NICM and cardiogenic shock, admitted for bone marrow biopsy as part of leukopenia work up prior to tranplant Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. Part 1 received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow aspiration clot on the requisition is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. Part 2 received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a red brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 2.3 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
