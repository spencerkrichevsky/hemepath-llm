Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Hypochromic normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia Numerous circulating blasts Bone Marrow Acute myeloid leukemia relapse, see comment Increased iron stores 02 13 2018 11 09 ddw NDN 02 13 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 78 shows an abnormal population in the same position CD45 SSC scattergram as the leukemic cells in original bone marrow sample in July 2017. The leukemic cells retain the same marker profile positive for CD13, CD33, CD38, CD4, CD7, CD117, CD34, HLA DR. They are negative for TdT. These findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia. The current findings of 82 myeloblasts in this patient with AML remission in 12 2017 are consistent with AML relapse Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, FISH panel for AML, AML molecular profile, PCR for FLT3, PCR for bcr abl1 Dr Rios and Kanaan were notified of the findings on 2 13 18 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type acute myeloid leukemia Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 78 Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information Clinical History 71 y o male with AML, diagnosed in 7 2017. The most recent BM in 12 2017 showed remission, normal AML FISH panel. Now patient with numerous blasts in PBS Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow clot on the requisition are multiple red brown portions of clotted blood measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a red brown, cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.2 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification. PY jjb 02 13 2018 10 30.
