Diagnosis Peripheral blood Pancytopenia Bone marrow Hypercellular for age 50 Presence of 5 monoclonal plasma cells, see comment Presence of a small benign lymphoid aggregate in clot section Adequate iron stores NDN 01 05 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 5 shows a T cell population with no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a B cell population that is negative for CD5, CD10, also no surface light chain restriction. Plasma cells account for less than 2 of the cells analyzed and show cytoplasmic kappa light chain restriction. They are positive for CD56 and negative for CD19. These results indicate presence of monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow. Immunohistochemical stains, with adequate controls, are performed on biopsy for CD138, kappa and lambda. The stains show 5 plasma cells positive for CD138 , most with expression for cytoplasmic kappa and negative for lambda light chain. The current findings are most supportive of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS . Clinical correlation is suggested. Bone marrow aspirate was sent for chromosome analysis and FISH panel for multiple myeloma Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 90 year old male with a history of monoclonal gammopathy less than 10 monoclonal plasma cells in recent bone marrow . Gross Description Part 1 received in formalin and labeled bone marrow clot is a 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood which is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A 1C. Part 2 received in formalin and labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a red brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
