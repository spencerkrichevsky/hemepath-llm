Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Pancytopenia Bone Marrow Hypocellular for age s p chemotherapy No morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of residual leukemia, see comment Increased iron stores NDN LZ 02 01 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 60 in gate 1 shows a T cell population about 90 of the cells analyzed with high CD4 CD8 ratio 8 1 , otherwise no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a small B cell population about 6 of the cells analyzed with no evidence of surface light chain restriction. Analysis of cells in gate 2 blast area shows a small number of normal myeloblasts 1 with expression of CD33 and CD13. These results indicate no residual leukemic population with flow cytometry in this patient with history of AML, s p chemotherapy. Reticulin and trichrome stains are pending on biopsy. Results will be reported in Addendum. Additional aspirate has been sent to Genoptix to perform cytogenetic analysis, AML molecular profile, and FLT3 mutation studies. Results will be issued separately in Addendum. Tumor Summary N A Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 83 y o female with AML, diagnosed on 11 6 17 with positive FLT3, IDH2, NPM1, and NRAS; negative for bcr abl1, AML FISH panel, cytogenetics. The most recent bone marrow on 12 26 17 showed 40 residual blasts Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin in a container and labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow clot on the requisition is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal red brown gelatinous cut surfaces. Tissue is serially cross sectioned to reveal red brown gelatinous cut surface. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin in a container and labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a red brown cylindrical core of bone with adherent clotted blood measuring 1.0 cm in length and up to 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after brief decalcification.
