Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Pancytopenia Bone Marrow Aplastic anemia, see comment Decreased iron stores 02 13 2018 10 52 ddw NDN 02 13 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment No evidence of malignancy is seen in bone marrow. The findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow are most supportive of aplastic anemia. Etiologies may include medication, viral infection, and immune disorders. Clincal correlation is suggested. Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information Pancytopenia Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow clot on the requisition is a red brown portion of clotted blood measuring _.8 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown, gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a red brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 1.9 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
