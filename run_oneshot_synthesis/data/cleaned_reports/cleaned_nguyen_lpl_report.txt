Diagnosis Peripheral blood Normocytic hypochromic anemia with rouleaux formation Bone marrow Normocellular for age 30 Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, see comment Decreased iron stores NDN DCR 06 18 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of leukocytes in bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 315 shows an abnormal B cell population about 60 of the lymphocytes analyzed, or 30 of bone marrow cells that is positive for CD19, CD20, CD22, FMC7, and surface kappa light chain restriction. These B cells are negative for CD5, and CD10. These B cells are small in nuclear size based on forward scatter signal . Analysis of CD38 positive cells shows a small abnormal plasma cell population with cytoplasmic kappa light chain restriction. They are negative for CD56. These results, together with morphological findings in bone marrow, are consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in this patient with a history of macroglobulinemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Bone marrow aspirate was sent for chromosome analysis, PCR for MYD88, and FISH panel for multiple myeloma Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 315 Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 78 year old male with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, K L ratio of 4.55 Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin and labeled clot is a red brown portion of clotted blood measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown, gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A 2. Received in formalin labeled core are two red brown, cylindrical cores of bone measuring 0.4 and 1.8 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
