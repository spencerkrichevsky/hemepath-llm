Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Pancytopenia Bone Marrow Myelofibrosis, see comment Increased iron stores NDN VJ 04 13 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Reticulin and Trichrome stains on biopsy show collagen fibrosis and reticulin fibrosis grade 2 out of 3 Immunohistochemical stains, with adequate controls, are performed on biopsy for CD34, CD117, MPO, Factor VIII, and ECadherin. The MPO and Ecdherin stains show increase in granulocytes and decrease in erythoids. CD34 shows less than 2 positive cells. CD117 shows normal distribution of early granulocytes. FVIII stain shows normal distribution of megakaryocytes. Diffuse myelofibrosis is seen in biopsy which is the cause of pancytopenia and paucity of aspirate cells. Primary myelofibosis or myelofibrosis due to other pre existing myeloproliferatibe neoplasms P. vera, CML, and essential thrombocythemia are unlikely due to lack of prefibrotic presentations. The current peripheral blood smear also shows no evidence of tear drop cells, NRBCs or leukocyte left shift, typical findings in myelofibrosis associated with MPNs. Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis is ruled out without increase in myeloblasts. Other etiologies are also unlikely lymphoma especially Hodgkin lymphoma , reneal osteodystrophy, metastatic carcinoma. The following etiolgies may be considered in this patient viral infection, auto immune disease such as SLE in this patient, among others. Clinical correlation is suggested. Bone marrow was sent for cytogenetics, and FISH panels for MDS and MPN, MPN molecular profile. Findings were discussed with Dr. G .Segal and Dr Juneja on 4 12 18 Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 39 year old female with history of SLE, thrombocytopenia, anemia, encephalopathy, auto immune hemolysis, PLEX for APLS. Bone marrow for workup of pancytopenia. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient s name and MRN. Part 1 received in formalin and labeled bone marrow is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 2.8 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassettes 1A 1C. Part 2 received in formalin and labeled bone marrow core is a red brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 2.1 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
