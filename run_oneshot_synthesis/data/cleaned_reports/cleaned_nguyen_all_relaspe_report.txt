Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Normochromic normocytic anemia Leukopenia Bone Marrow Residual leukemia B cell lymphoblastic leukemia , 61 lymphoblasts, s p chemotherapy Adequate iron stores 02 13 2018 10 57 ddw NDN 02 13 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 77 shows a predominant B lymphoblast population. These B cells have intermediate nuclear size based on forward scatter signal and show expression of CD10, CD19, CD38, HLA DR, CD13, CD33, CD34, and TdT. They are negative for CD20, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD7, CD56, CD117, MPO. This profile is similar to that of the diagnostic sample prior to treatment. The immunophenotype results and morphology are consistent with residual B cell lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow aspirate was sent for FISH panel for ALL, ALL fusion profile. Drs Rios and Kanaan were notified of the results on 2 13 18 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type B cell lymphblastic leukemia Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 77 Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 65 year old female with B cell ALL diagnosed in 1 2018, abnl FISH with 12 p , neg bcr abl1 by PCR; patient s p 1st cycle Ritux Mini HyperCVAD Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. 1. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow clot on the requisition is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring ___.3 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal red brown gelatinous cut surfaces. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient s name and bone marrow biopsy on the requisition is a 1.1 cm in length red brown, cylindrical core of bone measuring 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
