Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Hypochromic normocytic anemia. Moderate leukocytosis with left shift. Marked thrombocytosis. Bone Marrow Essential thrombocythemia, see comment Increased iron stores NDN DMS 05 02 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment The morphologic findings in peripheral blood, bone marrow and positive JAK2 V617F are supprtive of essential thrombocythemia. Bone marrow biopsy was sent for cytogenetics, MPN FISH panel, and MPN molecular profile NGS . Dr Idowu was notified of the findings on 5 2 18 Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type essential thrombocythemia Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry not performed Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information 50 year old male with JAK2 mutation and thrombocytosis platelet count 1,101 , s p SMA thrombectomy. Gross Description The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient s name and medical record number. Part 1 received in formalin and labeled clot is a red brown gelatinous portion of clotted blood measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. The clot is serially cross sectioned to reveal a red brown gelatinous cut surface. The clot is submitted in its entirety in cassette 1A. Part 2 received in formalin and labeled core is a tan brown cylindrical core of bone measuring 2.6 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 2A after a brief decalcification.
