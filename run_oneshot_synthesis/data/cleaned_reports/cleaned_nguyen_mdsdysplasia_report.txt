Diagnosis Peripheral Blood Pancytopenia Bone Marrow Myelodysplastic syndrome with multi lineage dysplasia Increased iron stores with no increase in ring sideroblasts A small benign lymphoid aggregate NDN JAA 06 19 2018 Electronic Signature Nguyen, Nghia Andy D MD Comment Immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry report HF 18 318 in Gate 1 by flow cytometry shows a T cell population about 87 of the cells analyzed with no aberrant loss or aberrant expression of T cell markers, a B cell population about 9 of the cells analyzed that is negative for CD5, CD10, no surface light chain restriction. The lymphocytes have small nuclear size based on forward scatter signal . Analysis of the cells in the blast area Gate 2 shows fewer than 2 normal myeloblasts of the bone marrow cells that are positive for CD13 and CD33. These results indicate no abnormal immunophenotypes with flow cytometry. Bone marrow aspirate was sent for cytogenetics, and FISH panel for MDS. Tumor Summary Specimen Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspiration Bone marrow aspirate clot Bone marrow core trephine biopsy Bone marrow core touch preparation imprint Procedure Bone marrow Aspiration site R posterior iliac crest Biopsy site R posterior iliac crest Histologic type MDS with multi lineage dysplasia Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemistry not performed Flow cytometry Performed, see separate report HF 18 xx Cytogenetic studies Performed, see separate report Specimen Source 1. Bone marrow aspirate and clot 2. Bone marrow core biopsy, decal, touch prep 3. Peripheral blood smear Bone marrow procedure was performed by IR Clinical Information Preop Diagnosis MDS Postop Diagnosis MDS 62 year old male with a history of MDS with complex karyotype, requiring frequent transfusions and no longer responding to neupogen; currently receiving Revlimid. Gross Description 1. Received in formalin labeled with the patient s name, mrn and date of birth is a blood clot measuring 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 1A. 2. Received in formalin labeled with the patient s name, medical record number consists of two cylindrical core biopsies measuring 1.2 and 1.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted after a brief light decalcification.

Megakaryopoiesis Adequate, more than 10 with dysplastic forms hypolobated nuclei or separate nuclear lobes Erythropoiesis Increased, with significant dysplasia present numerous forms showing nuclear cytoplasmic dyssynchrony, nuclear irregularity in contour and a few forms showing cytoplasmic vacuolation . Iron Content aspirate Increased iron stores; no increase in ring sideroblasts. Granulopoiesis Decreased, with normal maturation; no increase in blasts Lymphocytes Normal number and morphology. Biopsy and clot section A single small lymphoid aggregate is present in the clot section. The lymphocytes in the aggregate have small nuclei with mature cytology. No evidence of granuloma, or fibrosis is seen. Iron content biopsy and clot section Increased iron stores, no increase in ring sideroblasts.
