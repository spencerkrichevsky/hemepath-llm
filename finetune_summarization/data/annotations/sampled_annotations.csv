Markedly hypercellular marrow 90 cellularity with near complete effacement of normal hematopoietic elements by lymphoma. COMMENT Clinical correlation is recommended. The marrow is extensively involved by a monotypic population of large B cells, consistent with recurrent Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma. These cells are CD20 , PAX5 , CD10 , BCL6 , MUM1 , and exhibit a high proliferation rate Ki 67 80 . Flow cytometry confirms the presence of a clonal B cell population with similar immunophenotypic features. Cytogenetic and FISH studies are pending and may provide additional prognostic information.
